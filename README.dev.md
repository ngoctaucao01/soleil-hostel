# Development README — Running frontend + backend

This file documents how to run the project locally (Windows-optimized) and with Docker Compose. It also lists common troubleshooting steps.

## Summary
- Frontend: `frontend/` — React + TypeScript + Vite
- Backend: `backend/` — Laravel (PHP 8.x)
- DB: MySQL (optional when using Docker)

Two main approaches:
- Local (no Docker): install PHP/Composer/MySQL locally and run both servers
- Docker Compose: single command to start DB, backend and frontend

---

## Prerequisites (Windows)
- Node.js (16+/18+/20+)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn
- PHP 8.x and Composer (unless using Docker)
- MySQL (unless using Docker)
- (Optional but recommended) WSL2
- (If using Docker) Docker Desktop with WSL2 integration

---

## 1) Quick local setup (no Docker)
### Backend
```powershell
cd backend
composer install
copy .env.example .env  # or copy on Windows PowerShell: Copy-Item .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
# if you use MySQL, ensure DB settings in .env are correct and database exists
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000
```

### Frontend
```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev -- --host
# or with yarn
# yarn
# yarn dev --host
```

Access frontend (Vite) at `http://localhost:5173` and backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## 2) Run both with one command (concurrently)
From repo root:
```powershell
npm install --save-dev concurrently
npm run dev
```
`npm run dev` uses the root `package.json` script and will run both the Laravel dev server and Vite.

---

## 3) Docker Compose (recommended if you want a reproducible environment)
From repo root:
```powershell
docker compose up --build
```
This starts MySQL, backend and frontend. Backend listens on `8000`, frontend on `5173`.

Note about Dockerfiles and networking:
- This repository includes simple development `Dockerfile`s for `backend` and `frontend`. Compose is configured to build those images and mount your local source so you get live edits during development.
- When running the frontend inside Docker on Windows, `host.docker.internal` is the easiest way for the frontend container to contact a service running on the host (for example if you run Laravel with `php artisan serve` locally). We set `VITE_API_URL` in `frontend/.env` to `http://host.docker.internal:8000/api` by default. If you run the backend as a Compose service, use `http://backend:8000/api`h instead.

---

## 4) Common troubleshooting

### 404 on `/api/rooms`
- Ensure backend server is running: `php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000`
- Check `php artisan route:list` from `backend/` and look for `api/rooms`.
- Confirm `backend/routes/api.php` contains the resource route and `RoomController` exists under `app/Http/Controllers` with namespace `App\Http\Controllers`.

### CORS errors
- Update `backend/config/cors.php` allowed origins to include `http://localhost:5173`.

### Port conflicts
- Find the PID using the port: `netstat -ano | Select-String ":8000"` and then `Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force`.

### php/composer not found
- Add PHP and Composer to PATH or use WSL2 or Docker.

## Detailed troubleshooting checklist

If you're still stuck, follow this checklist in order — it covers the common root causes for 404/CORS/port issues on Windows + Laravel + Vite setups.

1) Confirm servers are running and ports

	- Backend (Laravel dev server):
	  ```powershell
	  cd backend
	  php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000
	  ```
	  Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in the browser — you should see the Laravel welcome page.

	- Frontend (Vite):
	  ```powershell
	  cd frontend
	  npm run dev -- --host
	  ```
	  Vite usually serves at `http://localhost:5173`.

2) If API returns 404 for `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/rooms`

	- Run `php artisan route:list` from `backend/` and look for `api/rooms`.
	- If the route is missing:
	  - Open `backend/routes/api.php` and confirm you have the route registration, for example:
		 ```php
		 use App\Http\Controllers\RoomController;
		 Route::apiResource('rooms', RoomController::class);
		 ```
	  - Confirm `backend/app/Http/Controllers/RoomController.php` exists and the namespace at top is `namespace App\Http\Controllers;`.
	  - If controller was added recently, run `composer dump-autoload`.

3) Clear caches (very common fix for route/controller issues)

	```powershell
	cd backend
	php artisan config:clear
	php artisan route:clear
	php artisan cache:clear
	composer dump-autoload
	php artisan route:list
	```

4) Check Laravel logs for exceptions

	- `backend/storage/logs/laravel.log`
	- If there are permission issues on Windows with mounted volumes, ensure files are writable by the PHP process (when using Docker)

5) Port conflicts on Windows

	- Find who uses the port (example for 8000):
	  ```powershell
	  netstat -ano | Select-String ":8000"
	  ```
	- Kill the blocking PID if it's safe:
	  ```powershell
	  Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force
	  ```

6) CORS from browser

	- If the browser console shows CORS, temporarily allow origins in `config/cors.php` during development:
	  ```php
	  'paths' => ['api/*'],
	  'allowed_methods' => ['*'],
	  'allowed_origins' => ['http://localhost:5173'],
	  'allowed_headers' => ['*'],
	  'supports_credentials' => false,
	  ```
	- After changing config, run `php artisan config:clear`.

7) Vite + API base URL mismatch

	- Ensure `frontend/.env` or Vite environment has `VITE_API_URL` set (ex: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api`).
	- We updated `frontend/src/services/api.ts` to read `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` with a fallback. If you change `.env`, restart Vite.

8) Using Docker — container troubleshooting

	- `docker compose ps` to see containers
	- `docker compose logs backend` to see Laravel output
	- If migrations fail in container startup, run them manually inside the container:
	  ```powershell
	  docker compose exec backend bash
	  php artisan migrate
	  ```

9) If all else fails

	- Try reproducing the exact request with `curl` or Postman to isolate browser/CORS vs server 404.
	- Share `php artisan route:list` output and the top 50 lines of `storage/logs/laravel.log` and I can help pinpoint the issue.

## 5) Next steps
- Wire `VITE_API_URL` into the frontend `src/services/api.ts` so the frontend reads endpoint from environment.
- Optionally create `Dockerfile`s for backend and frontend for a production-like setup.

If you'd like, I can:
- Wire `VITE_API_URL` into `src/services/api.ts` now.
- Add `Dockerfile`s for backend/frontend.
- Run `npm install` for `concurrently` automatically (I will not run installs without your confirmation).
